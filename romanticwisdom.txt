spiritual human, that are wise in where they are capable genius
that are anti-favoritist and don't believe in suboptimalisms or minimalisms that are spiritually anti-utopian in essence existencially
a life where there was not a genius burst or enlightenment is a life kind of wasted
and also replace beauty rates into (F) nobility/worthiness (M) rates

the system of grown up capable spiritual genius is from profound wisdom and complete soul-elevatedness, like live a life of Undefinable-worshipper and then progress further to your bright capable spiritual genius, and anything esoteric or idolatric is anti-spiritual in reality

say (sigma or spiritual wise) man not males
basically they are worthy soul wise men that free themselves of ego, but increase and recover their worthiness and genius and wisdom

and don't stay with or respect a person incapable of spirituality, they are worthless
and the past should be considered as experience, and possibilities should be considered by how pragmatic it is and how can it be made optimalistically

is this some sort of greatly wise spiritual genius, heavenly soul controlling man body or what is this whole point of "sigma's"? when introverted ambiversion makes for natural charismatic guided by his highest spiritual values, spiritually meaning inspiring capable goals, wisdom-intermediated actions? like a constant subconscious critical thinking installed into ourselves
they think wisely from the inside technically-spiritually optimalistically rather than emotionally outside

if you have a noble woman earned
then know that other girls become metaphysically guided passive in love for you, merely testing you, except her, and she's active when your prayer status is optimal or free

like follow Undefinable and His given wisdom, and master and understand His exceptional (metaphysical) gifts for you
also don't picture sigmas like werewolfs, but like spiritual wise inner capable geniuses

rather living like Undefinable-worshippers and being capable geniuses who care about what elevates their soul and what makes them universally spiritually optimalistic and whether things are spiritually optimalistic or not
starting in peace and spiritual prosperity they think the world is a capable spiritual utopia in its existence possibilities, then they understand that its a world filtering them between spiritual elites, the anti-favoritist wise, minimalist-like normals, and favoritists and evildoers

and you shouldn't forgive any livestock creatures-like unapologized sin against you
when you have achieved ultimatist spiritual morality, your preconscious (wisdom) would see what optimal would be needed or be inspired to have or be, and which people fall out of standards

solitude also means connecting with wisdom and being closer to Undefinable Lord, and developing universal spiritual optimalism

the ideology that challenges their ego is anti-favoritism in its full optimal meaning, like worship only Undefinable, and be a spiritual human, not esoteric or idolatric one
and romancy is quasi-physically built: mainly metaphysically judgementally, and physically emotionally receiving for them

just go to other girls, and your ideal of girl should be that she should be capable supporting you finding another girl happily
like say to them "stop testing or i'll go to others"

is it called spiritually granted profound wisdom and philosophicality?

anything harmful to elevated soul ultimately is to be avoided
anything that elevates and enlightens soul should be sought after

it's better to be spiritual technicality optimalistic 2000 to 1 sociality ratio (with which also comes enlightened profound wisdom) than to be a fuel of nextworld suffering

replace beauty rates with (f) nobility/worthiness (m) rates
and your ideal should be a girl who would be willing to give you another girl out of her effort and you saying (don't test me or give me others)
the charisma is in anti-favoritism
like what is a heart alike of quasar?

and enlightened people deflect their conformists by saying infront of them something like "May God destroy them!" and then they ghost them
and it's time for martial optimalism to replace martial games, jit-kun do is a part of martial optimalsim science

indeed, a non-enlightened woman is like a romantic robot

Mediocrity is lack of spirituality.
Life without spirituality is a life not worth living, and does not go beyond mediocrity
while spiritual life liberates us from mediocrity and ignorance
and gives us bliss and enlightenment and prosperity

sincere open mindedness is keys for wise creativity
and geniuses soul lives on profound wisdom optimalistically
