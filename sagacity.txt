God is the One Undefinable Lord of Existence, the One without a like or relative, the Most Gracious one for Spiritual people

And do not glorify anyone other than One God alone.
Being true to Spiritual Wisdom, you will get Enlightenment, greater knowledge and elevation above all, and victory even over hypocrites

As a spiritual need to have one's good homeland, you should keep its culture clean of cultural parasitism, as one should keep its Spiritual Wisdom pure of antispiritual impurity that includes idolatric attributes, as one should choose better options for things or people of prowess

spiritual people are wise in where they are capable genius.
They are anti-favoritist and anti-fanatist and don't believe in suboptimalisms that are spiritually anti-utopian in essence existencially
a life where there was not a genius burst or enlightenment is a life kind of wasted
and also replace in romantic worth what you count beauty rates into women's nobility or men's worthiness rates

the system of grown up capable spiritual genius is from profound wisdom and complete soul-elevatedness, like live a life of Undefinable-worshipper and then progress further to your bright capable spiritual genius, and anything esoteric or idolatric is anti-spiritual in reality

say wise people, not with your fancy names for them
they are spiritually sincere wise men that free themselves of ego, and increase and recover their worthiness and genius and wisdom

and don't stay with or respect a person incapable of spirituality, they are worthless
and the past should be considered as experience, and possibilities should be considered by how pragmatically optimalistic they are

that is like a greatly wise spiritual genius, heavenly soul controlling man body of what society views as a wise man under their fancy names. When introverted ambiversion makes for natural charismatic guided by his highest spiritual values, spiritually meaning inspiring capable goals, wisdom-intermediated actions? like a constant subconscious critical thinking installed into ourselves that is like a brutal opportunistic vigilance.
They think wisely from the inside technically-spiritually optimalistically rather than emotionally outside

if you have a noble woman earned
then know that other girls become metaphysically guided passive in love for you, merely testing you, except her, and she's active when your prayer status is optimal or free

like follow Undefinable and His given wisdom, and master and understand His exceptional (metaphysical) gifts for you
also don't picture wise men like werewolfs, but like spiritual wise inner capable geniuses

rather living like Undefinable-worshippers and being capable geniuses who care about what elevates their soul and what makes them universally spiritually optimalistic and whether things are spiritually optimalistic or not
starting in peace and spiritual prosperity they think the world is a capable spiritual utopia in its existence possibilities, then they understand that its a world filtering them between enlightened spiritual elites, the wise people, morally healthy people, and morally weak people and evildoers

and you shouldn't forgive any morally-deaf person's unapologized sin against you, for opportunistic apology is not a real apology, but merely a regret used only against conformist societies
when you have achieved ultimatist spiritual morality, your preconscious (wisdom) would see what optimal would be needed or be inspired to have or be, and which people fall out of standards

solitude also means connecting with wisdom and being closer to Undefinable Lord, and developing Transcend Spiritual Optimalism and understanding Existence possibilities wisely

the ideology that challenges their ego is anti-favoritism in its full optimal meaning, like worship only Undefinable, and be a spiritual person, not esoteric or idolatric one
and romancy is superphysically built: mainly metaphysically judgementally, and physically emotionally receiving for them

just go to other girls, and your ideal of girl should be that she should be capable supporting you finding another girl happily
like say to them "stop testing or i'll go to others"

Wise person is the actually good person:
The women value men for their wisdom
The worthiest leader is the wisest one
Wise people guard themselves from temptations
Enlightened people become Prophets of Eternal Truth
Nations should be Aretocratic

is it called spiritually granted profound wisdom and philosophicality?

anything harmful to elevated soul ultimately is to be avoided
anything that elevates and enlightens soul should be sought after

it's better to be spiritually technically optimalistic (with which also comes enlightened sagacity) 2000 to 1 sociality ratio than to be a fuel of nextworld suffering

replace beauty rates with (f) nobility/worthiness (m) rates
and your ideal should be a girl who would be willing to give you another girl out of her effort and you saying (don't test me or give me others)
the charisma is in anti-favoritism

like what is a heart alike of quasar?
and phenomena should be reflected comparably to Existence possibilities spiritually optimalistically
and transcend your emotions intuitionally to enlightening sagacity, that is mastery of social genius, and Prophethood is the pinnacle of political genius

and enlightened people deflect their conformists by saying infront of them something like "May God destroy them!" and then they ghost them
and it's time for martial optimalism to replace martial games, jit-kun do is a part of martial optimalism science

indeed, a non-enlightened woman is like a romantic robot
and you should be opportunistic over morally weak people that are like social livestock, for they will be opportunistic over you if you show any personality weaknesses, and mediocre people disregard sagacity, viewing other's opportunisms as the only deciding values

Mediocrity is lack of spirituality.
Life without spiritual wisdom is a worthless antispiritual madness, and does not go beyond mediocrity
while spiritually wise life liberates us from mediocrity and ignorance
and earns us bliss and prosperity and God's Grace and guides us to the enlightenment

The spiritually wise people's nations are united, and will be taught Eternal Truth, if they will accept Spiritual Wisdom then their Scriptures will remain and they will become blessed nations

and temples should have Spiritual Wisdom as spiritual science, not idolatrous fabrications named as religion, for any science that matters has their own base and their own genius, and it's own subjective pseudosciences
and conformist societies are mediocre and rebel against spiritual wisdom and are not worthy of your connection. Spiritual sagacity and your noble wife will reassure and God's Favours would be with you

sincere open mindedness and ambitiousness for exotic knowledge are keys for wise creativity that is visionary
and pure-souled live Existence and wisdom spiritually optimalistically

Genius transcends all creativity which transcends intelligence, spirituality transcends all worldly matter, while God's Grace transcends all qualities and sagacity that transcends all erudition
and enlightened spiritual hero's wisdom is like of Spiritual Utopia's knowledge, and will be guided into Prophethood that transcends spiritual supergenius
and may God's outcasts be destroyed for their blatancy against anything spiritually mattering genius and Eternal Truth

Universal Spiritual Optimalism with prayer genius elevates one's spiritual sagacity
and spiritual aretocratic politics oustandingly elevates one in spiritual prowess

The only Lord and Friend a person needs is God alone
